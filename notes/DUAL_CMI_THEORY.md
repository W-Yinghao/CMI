# DUAL-CMI THEORY — the definitive answer

**Question.** *Do you agree the dual-CMI framework (encoder `I(Z;D|Y)` + decoder
`I(Y;D|Z)`, both variational, focused on psychiatric cross-site DG, aimed at
AAAI/ICLR) is right — and why do the two terms fight?*

This document is assembled from the four verified theory pillars
(`notes/theory/01_tension.md … 04_positioning.md`), their numerical checks
(`verify_tension.py`, `verify_resolution.py`, both re-run and **passing** in this
pass), the implemented `dual` method in `cmi/train/trainer.py`, and the live
experimental jobs. Every number below is reproduced, not asserted.

## (1) VERDICT — PARTIAL AGREEMENT

**Yes to the decomposition and the dual framing; no to "minimize both to zero."**

- The encoder/decoder split is **mathematically correct and exact**. `I(Z;D|Y)`
  (encoder leakage / covariate term) and `I(Y;D|Z)` (decoder leakage / concept
  term) are the two legs of one chain-rule identity (A1, below). This is not a
  heuristic pairing; it is forced by the chain rule of mutual information.

- The dual framing is **publishable** — as a *unification + tension* result for
  **psychiatric cross-site DG**. It correctly places Zhao19 (the marginal trap),
  GLS/Combes20 (the encoder term + label reweighting), and entropyDG (the
  decoder-flavoured term) as three faces of one identity, and adds the
  **concept term as a first-class, estimated quantity** that all three omit.

- **BUT** naively asking the optimizer to drive *both* CMIs to zero is
  **self-defeating under label shift**. The tension theorem (A2/A3) proves that,
  with a conditionally-invariant encoder (`I(Z;D|Y)=0`), the decoder leakage is
  *forced* to exactly `I(Y;D) − I(Z;D) > 0`. You cannot wish it away; the only
  noiseless escape (A3) is unreachable in clinical EEG. **The real contribution is
  not "minimize both" — it is the label-correction operator (A4) that *decouples*
  the two so that minimizing both becomes feasible.** Stated as "minimize both,"
  the framework is wrong; stated as "label-correct, then the two decouple and the
  residual `I(Y;D|Z)` is genuine concept shift," it is right and novel.

**One-line verdict:** *The dual decomposition is exactly right; the naive dual
objective is wrong under label shift; the GLS label correction is what makes the
dual objective well-posed, and the surviving `I(Y;D|Z)` is the paper's true
deliverable — a measurable concept-shift diagnostic for psychiatric cross-site
data.*

## (2) THE EXACT IDENTITY + THE TENSION PROOF + VERIFIED NUMBERS

### Identity A1 (exact, holds for **any** joint `p(Z,Y,D)`)

```
I(Z;D|Y) − I(Y;D|Z) = I(Z;D) − I(Y;D).                     (A1)
```

**Proof (one line of chain rule).** Expand the joint information the pair
`(Y,Z)` carries about `D` in the two orders:
```
I((Y,Z);D) = I(Y;D) + I(Z;D|Y)        (condition on Y first)
           = I(Z;D) + I(Y;D|Z)        (condition on Z first).
```
Both equal the same budget `I((Y,Z);D)`; equate and rearrange → (A1). ∎
(`notes/theory/01_tension.md` §a; `verify_tension.py` block `[i]`.)

**Interpretation.** A1 is a *conservation law*: the total domain information in
the (label, representation) pair can be attributed two ways, and the two
attributions must agree — which couples the encoder and decoder leakages.

### Tension theorem A2 (the fight) + A3 (the unreachable escape)

> **A2.** If the encoder is conditionally invariant, `I(Z;D|Y)=0`, then from A1
> ```
> I(Y;D|Z) = I(Y;D) − I(Z;D).                                (A2)
> ```
> Under label shift `I(Y;D) > 0`, this is **strictly positive** unless
> `I(Z;D)=I(Y;D)`. Driving the encoder leakage to zero *forces* the decoder
> leakage *up* by exactly the label-shift gap.

> **A3 (escape) — CORRECTED (P0-3).** Both CMIs vanish jointly **iff** `I(Z;D)=I(Y;D)`. Under a
> Markov chain `D→Y→Z` the DPI gives `I(Z;D) ≤ I(Y;D)`, with **equality iff `D ⊥ Y | Z`** — i.e. `Z` is
> *sufficient for the `D`-relevant part of `Y`*. This is **NOT** the same as `Y=f(Z)` (zero Bayes error); the
> earlier "iff zero Bayes error" claim was **wrong**.
> *Counterexample:* `A,B` independent, `D=A`, `Y=(A,B)`, `Z=A`. Then `D→Y→Z` holds, `I(Z;D|Y)=I(Y;D|Z)=0`
> (both vanish) and `I(Z;D)=I(Y;D)=H(A)`, yet `H(Y|Z)=H(B)>0`, so `Y` is **not** a function of `Z`. ⟹ joint
> vanishing does **not** require zero Bayes error — only that `Z` carry all of `Y`'s information *about `D`*.
> What survives: the two CMIs are still coupled by the chain-rule identity `I(Z;D|Y)−I(Y;D|Z)=I(Z;D)−I(Y;D)`;
> under **label-prior shift** raw-marginal invariance and class-conditional invariance genuinely conflict; and a
> *stronger* (binary-`Y` / minimal-sufficient-`Z` / no-redundant-label-component) assumption is needed before
> any zero-Bayes-error statement. The general "must fight ⟺ irreducible label noise" claim is **retracted**.

### Verified numbers — anchor **A2** (`verify_tension.py [iv]`, re-run, exact)

A 2-domain, binary-`Y`, binary-`Z` construction with a *fixed invariant* symmetric
encoder `p(z=1|y=1)=p(z=0|y=0)=a=0.8241` and per-domain priors
`p(y=1|d)=0.5∓0.2000`:

```
I(Z;D|Y) = 4.4e-16  ≈ 0      (encoder invariant by construction)
I(Y;D)   = 0.0823            (label shift present)
I(Z;D)   = 0.0340
I(Y;D|Z) = 0.0483  = I(Y;D) − I(Z;D)   ✓  (the forced decoder leakage)
```

**Monotone tradeoff** (`verify_tension.py [ii]`, fixed invariant encoder, shift
strength `s`): `I(Z;D|Y)` pinned at ≤4.4e-16 for all `s`, while the forced
`I(Y;D|Z)=I(Y;D)−I(Z;D)` grows monotonically `0 → 0.0108 → 0.0444 → 0.1050 →
0.2039 → 0.3268` as `s: 0→0.95`. Identity A1 holds across **3000 random discrete
joints** to **max abs error 2.22e-15** (machine precision). The encoder objective
and the decoder objective genuinely fight, and the fight scales with label shift.

---

## (3) WHY THEY FIGHT — in physical terms

Strip the algebra. Under **label shift** the class proportions `π_d(y)=p(y|D=d)`
differ across sites (e.g., one clinic enrolls 60% depressed, another 30%).

1. **You make the encoder conditionally invariant.** You force `p(z|y)` to be the
   same in every domain (`I(Z;D|Y)=0`). The *shape* of each class cluster in
   feature space is now domain-identical — good, no covariate leakage.

2. **But the feature marginal `p(z)` is a label-prior-weighted mixture of those
   clusters:** `p(z|d) = Σ_y π_d(y) p(z|y)`. Because the *mixing weights* `π_d(y)`
   differ by site (label shift) while `p(z|y)` is now shared, **`p(z)` itself still
   carries the label-prior shift** — the high-prevalence class dominates the
   feature cloud at one site and not the other. The domain signal you evicted from
   the *conditional* `p(z|y)` re-enters through the *marginal* mixing weights.

3. **A decoder reads `p(y|z) ∝ π_d(y) p(z|y)`.** Since `π_d(y)` differs by site,
   the **same point `z` implies a different label posterior at different sites** —
   so `p(y|z,d) ≠ p(y|z)`, i.e. `I(Y;D|Z) > 0`. The decoder *cannot* be invariant.
   This is not a training artifact; it is exactly the `I(Y;D)−I(Z;D)` of A2: the
   part of the label-prior shift the invariant encoder could not absorb resurfaces
   in the decoder.

4. **The escape (A3, CORRECTED) is `D ⊥ Y | Z`** — `Z` is *sufficient for the `D`-relevant part of `Y`* (so the
   same `z` implies the same label posterior at every site), **NOT** zero Bayes error. This is the GLS
   sufficiency condition and is weaker than `Y=f(Z)`; `H(Y|Z)>0` does **not** by itself block it. So the
   honest statement is: the **raw** dual objective fights under label shift (A2), and the resolution is the GLS
   label correction (A4), which sends `I(Y;D)→0` and **decouples** the two terms — *not* "the fight is
   unavoidable in noisy EEG." (The earlier "only escape = zero Bayes error / fight is real on our data"
   framing is **retracted**; the GLS decoupling, already the paper's stated contribution, is the resolution.)

**Plain English:** an invariant encoder pushes the domain signal out of the feature
*shapes* and into the feature *prevalences*; the decoder, which sees prevalences,
then has to be domain-dependent. You cannot zero both ends while the prevalences
differ — unless you neutralize the prevalence difference itself. That is (4).

---

## (4) THE RESOLUTION = the real contribution (the three-shift spine)

The single cause of the fight is the label-shift gap `I(Y;D)` sitting on the RHS of
A1. **Remove it by importance reweighting** (Generalized Label Shift, Combes et
al., NeurIPS 2020):

> **A4 (GLS resolution).** Fix a reference prior `π*(y)`. Reweight each domain by
> `w_d(y) = π*(y)/π_d(y)`, giving `p̃(z,y,d) ∝ w_d(y) p(z,y,d)`. Then every domain
> shares prior `π*`, so `Ỹ ⟂ D` and **`Ĩ(Y;D)=0`**. Identity A1 under `p̃` becomes
> ```
> Ĩ(Z;D|Y) = Ĩ(Y;D|Z) + Ĩ(Z;D).                              (★)
> ```
> All three terms are non-negative MIs, **linked additively with all-positive
> signs**: there is no longer a forced trade-off where lowering one raises the
> other. An invariant + sufficient `Z` now makes all three vanish *together*,
> with **no requirement of zero Bayes error** — irreducible noise `H(Y|Z)>0` is
> fully compatible with `Ĩ(Y;D|Z)=0`, because the noise is now domain-independent.

**Verified** (`verify_resolution.py`, re-run, `ALL PILLAR-2 CLAIMS VERIFIED: True`).
On the exact A2 fight joint:

| quantity        | original (fight) | reweighted (π* = avg / uniform) |
|-----------------|-----------------:|--------------------------------:|
| `I(Z;D)`        | 0.034010         | 0.000000 |
| `I(Y;D)`        | **0.082302**     | **0.000000** (label shift removed) |
| `I(Z;D|Y)` enc  | 0.000000         | 0.000000 |
| `I(Y;D|Z)` dec  | **0.048292**     | **0.000000** (tension gone) |

`I(Z;Y)` (predictive content) is **unchanged** by reweighting — GLS buys
invariance of both leakages without sacrificing the encoder's ability to predict
`Y` (verified: `I(Z;Y)=0.2564` before = after, `verify_tension.py [iii]`).

### The three-shift decomposition (the paper's spine)

| shift type | quantity | handled by | what survives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **covariate** | `I(Z;D|Y)` (encoder) | conditional-invariance regularizer | → 0 |
| **label** | `I(Y;D)` via `π_d(y)` | GLS reweighting `w_d(y)=π*(y)/π_d(y)` | → 0 |
| **concept** | `I(Y;D|Z)` (decoder, **residual after correction**) | explicit `I(Y;D|Z)→0` penalty | **diagnostic readout** |

**The residual `I(Y;D|Z)` after label correction is genuine CONCEPT shift** —
differing label-generating mechanisms across sites (different diagnostic criteria,
rater conventions, inclusion thresholds: a clinic that calls borderline cases
"depressed" vs one that does not). This is *exactly* what GLS structurally omits
(it assumes the residual is 0 / absorbs it into BER). The **CONTROL experiment**
proves the term is independent: with a *concept-shifted* (domain-dependent)
channel `p(z|y,d)`, GLS reweighting drives `Ĩ(Y;D)=0` but leaves
**`Ĩ(Y;D|Z)=0.1449 > 0`** — reweighting alone does *not* touch it; only the
explicit decoder constraint does (`verify_resolution.py`, CONTROL block).

**Positioning in one line:** *GLS = invariance + label correction (kills the
encoder term and the label-shift gap); ours = GLS + explicit `I(Y;D|Z)` control
(kills/measures the concept-shift term GLS leaves in BER), in the multi-source DG
regime, for psychiatric cross-site EEG.*

### How the code realizes it (`cmi/train/trainer.py`)

The `dual` method (`is_dual = method == "dual"`, `trainer.py:66`) is the **only**
method optimizing both CMIs. Step B (`trainer.py:206–211`):
```python
if is_dual:                                  # DUAL: encoder I(Z;D|Y) + decoder I(Y;D|Z)
    r_enc = post.reg("lpc_prior", z, yb)     # KL(q_dzy ‖ log_pi_y[y]) — UPPER bound on I(Z;D|Y)
    r_dec = ce_q - post.iib_ce_h(z, yb, db)  # CE_q(Y|Z) − CE_h(Y|Z,D) = H(Y|Z)−H(Y|Z,D) = Î(Y;D|Z)
    loss = loss + lam_t * r_enc + gamma_t * r_dec
```
- `r_enc` = posterior-KL **plug-in estimator** of `I(Z;D|Y)` (consistent at convergence, NOT an upper bound) (Barber–Agakov; safe to
  minimize — driving it to 0 forces the true CMI to 0). Verified: `E KL ≥ I(Z;D|Y)`
  for all perturbed `q`, equality at optimum `0.194167` (`03_estimators.md` §a).
- `r_dec` = entropy-gap **consistent plug-in** for `I(Y;D|Z)` (exact at the joint
  optimum `q=p(y|z), h=p(y|z,d)`, `=0.198942`; over-estimate if `q` loose,
  under-estimate if `h` under-fit — so Step-A must converge).
- **Label correction** = the `--balance` flag (`trainer.py:67–71`): per-class CE
  weight `N/(n_cls·count_y)` = inverse-frequency = BER/GLS reweighting to uniform
  `π*` — this is anchor A4 in the task loss. `dual` only escapes the A2/A3 tension
  **when paired with `--balance`** (or a matched `prior_mode`).
- Weights map to the objective directly: `λ_enc ≡ lam_t`, `λ_dec ≡ gamma_t`, both
  warmed. Two-step alternating (Step A fits posteriors on detached `z`; Step B
  moves only the encoder) — **not adversarial**, hence more stable than DANN/GRL.

(*dual mean over the 9 completed targets; matched-9 means: erm 76.7, lpc 75.9,
iib 80.9, dual 76.7.)

**What MUMTAZ already tells us (consistent with the 4 prior validations):**
- `dual` and `lpc_prior` cut **encoder leakage 60–80×** (1.6 → ~0.02 nats);
  `iib` (decoder-only) does **not** reduce encoder leakage (expected — it never
  touches `I(Z;D|Y)`). This cleanly separates the two terms on real data.
- On **mean accuracy**, `dual ≈ lpc ≈ erm` within target-to-target noise; `iib`
  edges ahead here but with full leakage. **This is parity, not a win** — exactly
  the empirical-findings position. The `--balance` (A4-corrected) arms (846930/932)
  are the ones that test the *resolution* claim and are still running.
- Note: MUMTAZ is small and several targets are degenerate (tgt5 ~0, tgt3 low for
  all methods) — per-target variance is high; this dataset will inform, not settle.

## (6) HONEST TOP-VENUE ASSESSMENT

**The defensible claim is a provable-gap / worst-case / calibration-control result
plus the theory, focused on psychiatric cross-site DG — NOT a mean-accuracy-beats-
ERM claim.** Four independent validations show invariance **ties** ERM on mean
balanced accuracy (the universal DomainBed result), and MUMTAZ above reproduces it.

**Do claim (each backed):**
1. **The tension theorem (A2/A3) as a formal proposition** + the GLS resolution
   (A4) framed *as resolving a tension between two simultaneously-desired CMIs*.
   This framing is, to our reading, **not stated in Zhao19 / GLS / entropyDG**
   (GLS has the reweighting but only one CMI). This is the one piece reviewers
   cannot attribute to prior art. (Pillar 4 §2–3.)
2. **The three-shift CMI decomposition as one identity** (covariate / label /
   concept), with the **concept term `I(Y;D|Z)` as a measured nat-valued
   diagnostic** of differing diagnostic criteria across clinical sites. This is the
   application-novel, AAAI-fit contribution. The CONTROL experiment proves the
   concept term is independent of GLS correction.
3. **Provable / worst-case control:** the leakage estimator is rock-solid
   (60–80× reduction here; proxy-validated `r=0.85` vs independent kNN `Î(Z;D|Y)`),
   and the natural headline is **worst-site robustness + calibration (ECE/NLL)**
   under label shift, where invariance + correction has a principled edge — not
   the mean-acc number.

**Do NOT claim:**
- "We beat ERM on mean accuracy." We do not, on balanced tasks (4 validations +
  MUMTAZ). Saying so would be refuted by our own runs.
- That the chain-rule identity A1 is *the* contribution. It is one line of
  algebra (a skeptic's "just MI bookkeeping" objection is *correct* about the
  algebra). Sell the **use** — separable, estimable, clinically meaningful shift
  diagnostics — and the **tension→resolution** dynamics, not the identity.

**Venue verdict (Pillar 4):**
- **AAAI-27 main track: viable as positioned**, conditional on the empirical
  concept-shift evidence (job 846957 + the `--balance` ADFTD/MUMTAZ arms showing
  residual `I(Y;D|Z)>0` that the explicit penalty reduces, with a
  robustness/calibration payoff). AAAI rewards a correctly-positioned framework +
  a clinically real use case over a raw SOTA delta. **This is our lane.**
- **ICLR: borderline** without one of (a) a *new generalization bound* in the
  three CMIs (carrying the concept residual explicitly, tighter/more estimable
  than Zhao19's unestimable `|f_S−f_T|`), or (b) a clear benchmark win over
  IWDAN/IWCDAN/entropyDG on a shared label-+concept-shift protocol. The
  decomposition + tension alone will not clear ICLR's novelty bar.

**The linchpin (hostage to experiments):** *show `I(Y;D|Z)` is non-zero after GLS
reweighting + encoder invariance on real psychiatric cross-site data, and that
penalizing it improves worst-site accuracy / calibration.* If that empirical
concept-shift story is weak, the paper collapses to "we re-derived GLS and added an
entropy term." If it holds, the dual-CMI framework is a clean, honest, defensible
AAAI paper.
