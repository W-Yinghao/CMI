# ACAR v4 — C1/C2 compatibility-replay READINESS **(executable, AUTHORIZATION-gated; NO replay run)**

```
STATUS : run_substrate_compatibility.py is an EXECUTABLE, authorization-gated fixed-candidate DEV substrate-compatibility
         replay. C1 = two-commit split + auth gate + taxonomy. C2 = REAL replay body under the FROZEN B1b source-state (NO
         refit): _load_frozen_substrate + _reembed_dev_under_substrate + _derive_under_frozen_source_state (never
         build_cohort_input) + REAL _extract_fixed_candidate_stats. C3 = REAL raw-window↔v3-WindowKey alignment by-key vs the
         sha-pinned DEV feat-dump metadata + EXACT eval_L_harm_all (all-batch denominator; replaces the harm_rate proxy;
         harm_among_adapted descriptive only); the ONLY remaining C-run frontier is the single DEV-raw read
         (_load_subject_raw_windows). NO replay was run: without a valid compatibility authorization manifest it
         fails closed (SubstrateCompatibilityNotAuthorizedError) before any torch/cmi import or DEV read. Synthetic-tested only.
         NO DEV raw read, NO re-embedding, NO held-out/external read, NO acar-v4-protocol tag. v2/v3 untouched; lockbox SEALED.

```

## 1. Two-commit split (the key C1 design — avoids the dead-lock)
The substrate-compat manifest now pins TWO commits instead of one ambiguous `protocol_commit`:
```
substrate_protocol_commit     = b99fa4f…   (the FROZEN substrate-generation code that trained the PD/SCZ substrates)
compatibility_protocol_commit = <C1 commit>  (this executable-replay code)
```
The runner requires `HEAD == compatibility_protocol_commit` (NOT the substrate commit), so the b99fa4f substrates stay
authoritative artifacts while the replay runs under the C1 commit. `validate_substrate_manifest` REJECTS the retired bare
`protocol_commit`. The substrates are NOT retrained or modified.

## 2. Compatibility authorization manifest (schema only; NOT created)
`regen_substrate.validate_compat_authorization` + `COMPAT_AUTH_FIELDS` + `REQUIRED_COMPAT_STATEMENT`:
```json
{
  "compatibility_protocol_commit": "<C1 commit; HEAD must == this at run>",
  "substrate_protocol_commit": "b99fa4fcfb83c6ee60996c50dba6828d40561f26",
  "substrate_manifest_sha256": "<sha256 of the substrate-compat manifest FILE bytes>",
  "env_lock_sha256": "61e505b3…",
  "output_path": "<absolute new nonexistent output directory>",
  "authorized_by": "...", "authorization_time": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "statement": "Authorize fixed-candidate DEV substrate compatibility replay exactly under ACAR_V4_SUBSTRATE_REGEN_COMMAND.md"
}
```
`run_substrate_compatibility._load_compat_authorization` BINDS it: compatibility_protocol_commit / substrate_protocol_commit /
substrate_manifest_sha256 (== the file sha of THIS manifest) / env_lock_sha256 / output_path must all match. Missing/invalid →
fail before any torch/cmi import, DEV read, or output claim.

## 3. Substrate-compat manifest schema additions (for the replay data source)
Per disease, in addition to the 4 unambiguous artifact hashes (H5): `dev_input_manifest_path` + `dev_input_manifest_sha256`
(the B1b regen input manifest — pins the EXACT eligible DEV universe to re-embed: PD 230 / SCZ 225, ds004000/sub-042 excluded,
FROZEN_PIPELINE, cohort-aware keys — so the replay can NOT rediscover a different subject universe). Top-level: `env_lock_path`
(the substrate env lock, re-verified at replay). The stdlib preflight verifies the `*_file_sha256`, the dev-input-manifest file
sha, and the env-lock file sha.

## 4. Executable replay body (gated; `_run_compatibility_replay`)
Reached ONLY with a valid, bound authorization, under an atomic `os.mkdir(output)` claim:
```
_verify_runtime_matches_lock(spec)              # cuda + threads=1 + versions == the substrate env lock         (REAL)
_verify_substrate_semantic_hashes(spec)         # canonical encoder_state_dict + source_state_artifact == record (REAL; safe
                                                #   weights_only load + acar.v3 self-verifying load_frozen; no unsafe pickle)
frozen = _load_frozen_substrate(spec)           # per disease: EEGNet(weights_only) + load_frozen_source_state_artifact (REQUIRED; no refit)
reembed = _reembed_dev_under_substrate(spec,frozen)  # eligible old-seven DEV → NEW-encoder z + v3 keys + labels; build_deployment_batches
records,v2 = _derive_under_frozen_source_state(reembed)   # SourceStateRegistry(frozen art) + disease_exec_cache + run_c0 +
                                                #   real_adapter._emit_records over the v3 CV folds — NEVER build_cohort_input (no refit)
per_disease = run_dev_exploration(records, EXACTLY ONE config 1x1x1, g3=v2_replay) → _extract_fixed_candidate_stats   (REAL)
authorized,reason = regen_substrate.compatibility_replay_pass(per_disease)   # FROZEN pre-registered pass-line   (REAL)
status = SUBSTRATE_COMPATIBILITY_PASS | _FAIL
```
- **No-refit (C2, blocker 2):** the replay loads the FROZEN B1b PD/SCZ source-state artifacts (`load_frozen_source_state_artifact`,
  REQUIRED) and EXECUTES them (`SourceStateRegistry`→`disease_exec_cache`→`SourceStateArtifact.execute`; `run_c0`;
  `real_adapter._emit_records`). It DELIBERATELY never calls `real_adapter.build_cohort_inputs` / v3 `build_cohort_input` (which
  RE-FIT a per-cohort source-state) — enforced by a source-grep guard test. So the verdict checks the B1b substrate, not an
  implicit re-fit.
- **FIXED candidate only:** the exploration is pinned to EXACTLY ONE config (1×1×1: `score_families=[shift_margin]`,
  `policy_families=(benefit_ranked,)`, `losses=(harm_indicator,)`, `budget_by_loss={harm_indicator:0.10}`); no grid to reselect.
- **`_extract_fixed_candidate_stats` is a REAL deterministic accessor**: filters `result.reports` to the single
  (disease, benefit_ranked, harm_indicator) cell, fail-closes if not exactly one per disease or a disease/v2 is missing, and maps
  lambda_certified=`g4_harm_control_pass`, coverage, red, **L_harm_all_eval=`eval_L_harm_all`** (C3), v2_replay_red=`c0_red`
  (== the v2_replay comparator since g3=v2_replay), v2_evaluable=finite(c0_red).
- **(C3) EXACT EVAL harm — no proxy.** The gate uses `eval_L_harm_all`, the EXACT all-batch-denominator EVAL harm_indicator loss
  (subject-macro over ALL eval batches incl. identity/fallback), added as an ADDITIVE field to `develop.V4CandidateReport`
  (`RC.subject_losses_from_policy(np.stack([calibrated]), dr_ev, subj_ev, loss="harm_indicator").mean()`, mirroring
  `external_adapter.evaluate_stratum`). It is REQUIRED + finite (None/NaN ⇒ fail-closed). The conditional `harm_rate` is carried
  DESCRIPTIVELY as `harm_among_adapted` (None when nothing adapted) and NEVER gates. Zero-adaptation: `eval_L_harm_all=0.0`,
  `harm_among_adapted=None`, compatibility FAILS via the coverage gate (not via harm). The `develop` change is additive — it does
  NOT alter coverage/red/harm_rate/g4 or any existing v2/v3 number (manifest assertions are relative; v3 uses a separate module).
- **The pass-line** is the FROZEN `compatibility_replay_pass` (v2_replay HARD; per disease: CAL LTT λ* certified, coverage≥0.15,
  red>0, EVAL L_harm_all≤0.10, v2 evaluable, red>v2_replay_red; macro red>macro v2).
- **(C3) Raw-window↔v3-WindowKey alignment is REAL + synthetic-tested.** `_load_subject_windows_and_keys` aligns the re-embedded
  raw windows to the **sha-pinned DEV feat-dump metadata** (per-disease/cohort `dev_feat_dump_paths`+`dev_feat_dump_sha256`, the
  alignment SOURCE OF TRUTH) BY KEY (recording_id, window_index): every dump row must have a matching raw window and vice-versa,
  else FAIL-CLOSED (missing/extra/dup/shape) before any digest. The ONLY remaining C-run frontier is `_load_subject_raw_windows`
  — the single step that reads DEV raw EEG, run ONLY at the authorized C-run (controlled `SubstrateReplayNotWiredError`; tests
  inject a synthetic provider). Even an imperfect raw read can't yield a wrong verdict: the pinned dump metadata + by-key
  alignment fail-close on any mismatch. Everything else (frozen-substrate load, no-refit derive, alignment, 1×1×1 exploration,
  exact eval_L_harm_all extraction, pass-line) is REAL.

## 5. Result taxonomy (no selection/external/binding vocabulary)
`regen_substrate.SUBSTRATE_COMPAT_STATUSES = (SUBSTRATE_COMPATIBILITY_PASS, SUBSTRATE_COMPATIBILITY_FAIL,
OPERATIONALLY_ABORTED_NO_VERDICT)`. PASS/FAIL are written to `compat_RESULT.json` (last; `allow_nan=False`) +
`compat_manifest.json`. An operational failure removes the claimed output (no partial; ABORT is NEVER read as a FAIL). This is
the old-seven-DEV-substrate compatibility check — NOT a new DEV selection run, NOT external evidence; no SELECT / DEV_STOP /
V4_EXTERNAL_CONFIRMED / external-G2 / coverage-theorem vocabulary is emitted.

## 6. Synthetic guards (no real raw/torch/GPU)
two-commit required + retired `protocol_commit` rejected; `env_lock_path` required; per-disease dev-input fields required;
HEAD≠compatibility_protocol_commit → fail; reselection (candidate≠fixed) → fail; op-point drift → fail; missing/invalid compat
authorization → fail before import/read/output; authorization hash mismatch → fail; wrong statement / extra / missing field →
fail; fake replay body called exactly once only after authorization; PASS verdict & FAIL verdict both written; non-verdict
status → abort+cleanup; replay raising → output cleaned; the two inner frontiers raise the controlled
`SubstrateReplayNotWiredError`. Tests monkeypatch `_run_compatibility_replay`.

## Next sequence (separate decisions; NOT started)
1. (if the replay uses torch/GPU) capture/verify a runtime lock for the C1 commit;
2. rebuild the substrate-compat manifest with `compatibility_protocol_commit = <C1 commit>` (+ env_lock_path + per-disease
   dev_input_manifest fields);
3. run the fail-closed compatibility PREFLIGHT at detached C1 WITHOUT authorization → expect SubstrateCompatibilityNotAuthorizedError;
4. record; THEN ask for an explicit compatibility-replay authorization.
Only after that authorization may the old-seven DEV compatibility replay RUN (and the two frontiers be finalized + validated).
A PASS then unlocks ACAR_FROZEN_v4 + the acar-v4-protocol tag; a FAIL → DEV-only / new dated protocol, with NO post-hoc tuning
of candidate/score/loss/grid/comparator/thresholds.
